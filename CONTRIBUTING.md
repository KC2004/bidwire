# How to contribute

Hello and welcome! I'm so glad you're considering contributing -- the more
helping hands, the better, greater things we'll build.

As you may know, BidWire is being developed under the umbrella of
[Ragtag](https://ragtag.org), a volunteer team of technologists working for
progressive change. If you'd like to contribute to BidWire, I'd like to gently
encourage you to [join Ragtag](https://ragtag.org/join/) -- this will give you
access to our Slack, including the BidWire-specific channel where we discuss
upcoming work and generally hang out.

To see our currently-planned work, check out our [Pivotal
Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1996883).

If there is something you'd like to work on, get in touch so that we can help
you get set up, answer questions, and make sure there isn't already someone
working on the same thing.

## Submitting changes

Send a pull request to the BidWire master branch with a clear description
of what you've done. Please follow our coding conventions, and add tests.

(Read more about [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) and the [GitHub
workflow](https://github.com/asmeurer/git-workflow).)

## Coding conventions

We strive to comply with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). To
auto-format your code before submission, you can use `autopep8`, which is
included in this project's dev requirements:
```
$ autopep8 --in-place <your_file.py>
```

## Testing

We use [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for testing, and would love
it if you wrote unit tests for the code you contribute. If for whatever reason
you think it doesn't make sense to test your change, let us know in your pull
request description.

Thanks!
